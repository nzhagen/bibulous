The license that a physicist often takes on the path from his hypotheses to verified, observable, and repeatable conclusion is not justified here.''.},

Raimi comments on p. 522: ``This assertion, whatever it may mean, will be called Benford's Law because it has been thought by many writers to have originated with the General Electric Company physicist Frank Benford [2]. Certainly Benford popularized the problem, and he may well have been unaware that the polymathic Simon Newcomb, primarily an astronomer but also sometime editor of The American Journal of Mathematics, had also formulated the same law 57 years earlier [1]. There is ample precedent for naming laws and theorems for persons other than their discoverers, else half of analysis would be named after Euler. Besides, even Newcomb implied that the observation giving rise to the Benford law was an old one in his day. One would hate to change the name of the law now only to find later that another change was called for.''},

On page 529, Raimi writes ``If the first digits of all the tables in the universe obey some fixed distribution law, Stigler's or Benford's or some other, that law must surely be independent of the system of units chosen, since God is not known to favor either the metric system or the English system. In other words, a universal first digit law, if it exists, must be scale-invariant.''},

  abstract = {It has been observed that the first pages of a table of common logarithms show more wear than do the last pages, indicating that more used numbers begin with the digit 1 than with the digit 9. A compilation of some 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent sources shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first digits when the numbers are composed of four or more digits. An analysis of the numbers from different sources shows that the numbers taken from unrelated subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a much better agreement with a logarithmic distribution than do numbers from mathematical tabulations or other formal data. There is here the peculiar fact that numbers that individually are without relationship are, when considered in large groups, in good agreement with a distribution law---hence the name ``Anomalous Numbers.''\par  A further analysis of the data shows a strong tendency for bodies of numerical data to fall into geometric series. If the series is made up of numbers containing three or more digits the first digits form a logarithmic series. If the numbers contain only single digits the geometric relation still holds but the simple logarithmic relation no longer applies.\par  An equation is given showing the frequencies of first digits in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10 to 100, etc.\par  The equation also gives the frequency of digits in the second, third + place of a multi-digit number, and it is shown that the same law applies to reciprocals.\par  There are many instances showing that the geometric series, or the logarithmic law, has long been recognized as a common phenomenon in factual literature and in the ordinary affairs of life. The wire gauge and drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude scale of the astronomer and the sensory response curves of the psychologist are all particular examples of a relationship that seems to extend to all human affairs. The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a general probability law of widespread application.},

  remark = {From \cite{Logan:1978:FDP}: ``Benford's paper was published in 1938 in a journal of rather limited circulation and not usually read by mathematicians. It so happened that it was immediately followed in the same issue by a physics paper which became of some importance for secret nuclear work during World War II [H. A. Bethe, M. E. Rose, and L. P. Smith, `The Multiple Scattering of Electrons', Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. 78(4), 573--585 (1938)]. That is why Benford's paper caught the attention of physicists in the early 1940's and was much discussed. This led to the notes in Nature by Goudsmit and Furry [3] and Furry and Hurwitz [4] containing an effort to explain Benford's law. We considered it at that time merely a welcome diversion and did not expect that over thirty papers would be devoted to this subject in subsequent years.''

The lexicon is enjoying a period of enormous growth: The addition of $\approx 8500$ words/year has increased the size of the language by over 70\% during the past 50 years.'' From page 177: ``Consistent with Zipf's famous law, a large fraction of the words in our lexicon (63\%) were in this lowest-frequency bin. As a result, we estimated that 52\% of the English lexicon --- the majority of the words used in English books --- consists of lexical `dark matter' undocumented in standard references (12).''},

  abstract = {There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.},

  abstract = {It has been observed that the rank statistics of string frequencies of many symbolic systems (e.g., word frequencies of natural languages) follows Zipf's law in good approximation. We show that, contrary to claims in the literature, Zipf's law cannot be realized by the central limit theorem(s). The observation that a log-normal distribution of string frequencies yields an approximately Zipf-like rank statistics is actually misleading. Indeed, Zipf's law for the rank statistics is strictly equivalent to a power law distribution of frequencies. There are two natural ways to perform the infinite size limit for the vocabulary. The first one is the method of choice in the literature; it makes the upper word length bound tend to infinity and leads in the case of a multistate Bernoulli process via a central limit theorem to a log-normal frequency distribution. An alternative and for text samples actually better realizable way is to make the lower frequency bound tend to zero. This limit procedure leads to a power law distribution and hence to Zipf's law --- at least for Bernoulli processes and to a very good approximation for natural languages where it passes the $\chi^2$ test. For the Bernoulli case we will give a heuristic proof.},

  abstract = {That the ten digits do not occur with equal frequency must be evident to any one making much use of logarithmic tables, and noticing how much faster the first pages wear out than the last ones. The first significant figure is oftener 1 than any other digit, and the frequency diminishes up to 9.},
